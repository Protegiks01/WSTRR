I would like to get access to all the files in this protocl that should be audited in this format ["
ed25519/src/commitment.rs", .... 

i need all of thm in a python list and u can put it in a python file and dont miss any
one, so i need the files that if bugs is found would be valid so give me all of them and put it in audit_files.py, ignore file that should not be audited
