I notice that the security question provided is incomplete. The prompt states:

"## Security Question to Investigate:
[File: src/state_"

And then:

"Begin your investigation of: [File: src/state_"

Both of these trail off without providing the actual security question or vulnerability to investigate.

To conduct a proper security audit, I need the complete security question. Please provide:

1. The specific security concern or vulnerability pattern to investigate in the state machine coordinator
2. Any specific attack scenario or threat model to analyze
3. The complete question that was cut off after "[File: src/state_"

Without knowing what specific aspect of the coordinator state machine to investigate (e.g., state transition vulnerabilities, race conditions, message authentication bypass, timeout handling issues, etc.), I cannot perform a meaningful security analysis or determine if a vulnerability exists.

Please provide the complete security question so I can investigate it thoroughly according to the audit requirements.
