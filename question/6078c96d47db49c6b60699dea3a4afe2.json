  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceRequest] [Nonce Reuse - Critical] Are sign_id and sign_iter_id validated to be unique combinations, or can coordinator request nonces for already-signed messages causing nonce reuse?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceRequest] [Message Binding - Critical] Is there validation that the message bytes match the sign_id, preventing coordinator from switching messages after nonces are generated?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: NonceRequest::hash()] [Taproot Binding - Critical] For SignatureType::Taproot, is the merkle_root optional handling (lines 301-303) secure, or can None vs Some(root) cause signature malleability?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceRequest] [Sign Iter ID - High] Can sign_iter_id be arbitrarily large or wrap around, causing state machine confusion?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceRequest] [Empty Message - High] Can message be an empty Vec<u8>, causing signing of nothing and potential protocol bypass?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: NonceRequest::hash()] [Domain Separation - High] Are the three signature types (Frost/Schnorr/Taproot) sufficiently separated in hash (lines 297-305) to prevent cross-type attacks?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceRequest] [DoS - Medium] Can message be extremely large, causing memory exhaustion when stored or hashed?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceRequest] [DKG ID Mismatch - High] Is dkg_id validated to match a successfully completed DKG round, or can coordinator request signatures for invalid DKG?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: NonceRequest::hash()] [Merkle Root Validation - Medium] For Taproot signatures with Some(merkle_root), is the 32-byte merkle_root validated before hashing?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Nonce Count Mismatch - Critical] Is there validation that nonces.len() == key_ids.len(), or can mismatched lengths cause indexing errors?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Duplicate Key IDs - Critical] Are key_ids checked for duplicates, or can a signer claim multiple nonces for the same key_id?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Zero Nonce - Critical] Are nonces validated to be non-zero points (checking D and E), or can zero nonces enable signature forgery?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Message Mismatch - Critical] Is the message field validated to match the NonceRequest.message exactly, or can signer claim nonces for a different message?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: NonceResponse::hash()] [Nonce Compression - High] Does hashing compressed nonces (lines 362-363) ensure uniqueness, or can different point representations hash the same?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Key ID Range - High] Are key_ids validated to be within the signer's assigned range from DKG, or can out-of-range IDs be claimed?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Empty Response - High] Can key_ids and nonces be empty vectors, allowing a signer to participate without contributing?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Sign IDs Mismatch - High] Are dkg_id, sign_id, and sign_iter_id validated to match the NonceRequest, or can they be manipulated?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: NonceResponse::hash()] [Hash Order - Medium] Does hashing key_ids before nonces (lines 357-364) prevent reordering attacks?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [DoS - Medium] Can attacker send responses with thousands of key_ids/nonces causing expensive verification?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: NonceResponse] [Point Validation - Critical] Are nonce points D and E validated to be on the curve before compression, or can invalid points be accepted?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareRequest] [Nonce Response Validation - Critical] Are all nonce_responses validated to have matching dkg_id/sign_id/sign_iter_id, or can mixed responses from different rounds be included?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareRequest] [Message Consistency - Critical] Do all nonce_responses have the same message field, and does it match SignatureShareRequest.message?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareRequest] [Duplicate Nonces - Critical] Can nonce_responses contain duplicate signer_ids, allowing double-counting of nonces in binding value computation?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: SignatureShareRequest::hash()] [Missing Iter ID - High] Why is sign_iter_id not hashed (line 412-415), potentially allowing replay across iterations?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareRequest] [Threshold Check - Critical] Are there enough nonce_responses to meet the threshold, or can coordinator request signatures with insufficient participants?"
