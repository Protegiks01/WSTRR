  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Context Validation] Does the caller validate that the same ctx is used for both proof generation and verification, or could mismatched contexts cause legitimate proofs to fail?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Zero ID] If id is zero scalar, does this create any special cases in the challenge computation or proof verification that could be exploited?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Zero Secret] If the polynomial constant a is zero, does the proof still provide meaningful security guarantees, or does this leak information?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Medium - Scalar Overflow] Are scalar addition operations (k + c*a) performed with proper modular arithmetic to prevent overflow or wraparound?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Challenge Overflow] If the challenge c computation results in a value that overflows scalar representation, is this handled securely?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - ID Uniqueness] Does the protocol enforce that id values are unique across parties, and could duplicate ids enable any attacks?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [High - Malformed Deserialization] When deserializing ID from network messages, are all fields validated (id as valid scalar, kG as valid point, kca as valid scalar)?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [High - Point Encoding] Does the Point type used for kG validate point encoding during deserialization, preventing invalid curve points from being accepted?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - Scalar Range] Are deserialized scalar values (id, kca) validated to be in the correct range [0, curve_order), or could out-of-range values cause issues?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - Size Validation] Is there a maximum size constraint on serialized ID structs to prevent memory exhaustion attacks?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Low - Serialization Determinism] Is ID serialization deterministic, ensuring the same logical ID always produces the same byte representation?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Critical - DKG Integration] When ID proofs are used in DKG to bind party IDs to polynomial constants, does the caller verify all ID proofs before accepting any DKG shares?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Critical - Verification Timing] Is verify() called before accepting and using the claimed polynomial constant A, or could an attacker contribute to DKG without valid proofs?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Multiple Proofs] If a party creates multiple ID proofs with different id values but the same secret a, does this leak information about a through correlation?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [High - Batch Verification] When verifying multiple ID proofs, is each verified independently, or could batch verification introduce vulnerabilities?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [High - ID Mutation] After creation, can the ID struct fields be mutated, and would this invalidate the proof while maintaining structural validity?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Medium - Proof Freshness] Is there any mechanism to ensure ID proofs are fresh and not replayed from old sessions, or is ctx the only defense?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Concurrent Verification] Is the verify function safe to call concurrently on the same ID instance from multiple threads?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [High - Hash Function Security] Does the protocol rely on collision resistance, preimage resistance, or second preimage resistance of SHA-256, and are all properties needed?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Discrete Log Assumption] Does the security proof rely on the discrete logarithm assumption over the curve group, and are there any weaknesses if ECDLP is partially broken?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Zero Knowledge] Is the proof truly zero-knowledge, or does verification leak any information about the secret a beyond what's revealed by A?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Medium - Random Oracle Model] Does the security analysis assume hash_to_scalar behaves as a random oracle, and what breaks if this assumption fails?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Medium - Curve Choice] Is the proof secure for all elliptic curve groups, or are there specific curve properties (order, cofactor) that must be validated?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Computational DoS] Does verify perform expensive point operations, and could an attacker flood the system with invalid ID proofs to exhaust CPU?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Medium - Hash DoS] Can an attacker provide extremely long id scalars or ctx values to cause excessive hash computation time?"
