  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [High - Point Validation] Does verify perform complete point validation on A, including curve membership, subgroup membership, and non-identity checks?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Medium - Context Format] Are there any required format constraints on ctx bytes, or is arbitrary binary data acceptable?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Medium - Generic RNG Constraints] Does the RNG generic bound (CryptoRng + RngCore) provide sufficient guarantees for cryptographic security?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Critical - DKG Binding] Does verifying an ID proof guarantee that the party knows the discrete log of A, preventing rogue key attacks in DKG?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - ID Uniqueness Enforcement] Does the protocol layer ensure id values are unique per party, or could ID collision enable impersonation?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [High - Aggregation Safety] When multiple verified ID proofs are aggregated in DKG, does each individual verification guarantee security of the aggregated result?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Medium - Context Coordination] How is ctx coordinated among all parties, and could inconsistent ctx values cause legitimate proofs to be rejected?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Medium - Proof Binding Scope] What exactly does the ID proof bind (party ID to polynomial constant), and could this binding be insufficient for complete DKG security?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Error Cases] Does verify return false for all error conditions, or could some errors cause panics or unwraps?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Medium - RNG Failure] If Scalar::random() fails or panics, is this handled gracefully, or could it leave partial state?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Low - Hash Failure] Can hash_to_scalar fail, and if so, how is the failure propagated to callers?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Low - Point Operation Failure] Can point operations in the verification equation fail (invalid points, errors), and are failures handled correctly?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Timing Leakage] Do the scalar operations (k + c*a) execute in constant time, or could timing variations leak information about the secret a?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Cache Timing] Could cache timing attacks on point operations or scalar multiplications leak information about private values?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Low - Hash Timing] Does hash computation time vary based on input values in a way that leaks information?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Low - Memory Access Patterns] Could memory access patterns during ID operations leak sensitive information through side channels?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Caller Responsibility] What validations must callers perform before passing id and a to new(), and what happens if invalid inputs are provided?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [High - Post-Verification Usage] After verify returns true, what guarantees does the caller have about the relationship between id and A?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Medium - Hash Function Choice] Is SHA-256 hardcoded appropriately, or should the hash function be configurable for future cryptographic agility?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - Public Field Access] Should the id, kG, and kca fields be public, or does public access enable any protocol-level attacks?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Low - RNG Ownership] Is taking &mut RNG the correct ownership model, or should RNG be consumed or differently managed?"
