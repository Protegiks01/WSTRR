  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Message::hash()] [Exhaustive Match - High] Does the match in hash() (lines 110-122) cover all Message variants, or can new variants cause panics?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: Message] [Deserialization - Medium] Are there any serde deserialization vulnerabilities that could allow constructing invalid Message variants?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: SignatureType] [Type Switching - High] Can an attacker request nonces for Frost type but then request signature shares for Schnorr type, causing verification failures?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: SignatureType::Taproot] [None Merkle Root - High] Is Taproot with None merkle_root equivalent to plain Schnorr, or does it have different security properties?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: SignatureType] [Serialization - Medium] Can SignatureType be deserialized to invalid states that aren't Frost/Schnorr/Taproot?",

  "[File: src/net.rs] [Trait: PartialEq] [Comparison Safety - Low] Are PartialEq implementations on cryptographic types (Point, Scalar) constant-time to prevent timing attacks?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Trait: Clone] [Deep Copy - Low] Do Clone implementations properly deep-copy all fields, or could shared references cause mutation issues?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [All hash() methods] [Domain Separation - Critical] Are all domain separator strings (DKG_BEGIN, NONCE_REQUEST, etc.) unique and collision-resistant across all message types?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [All hash() methods] [Field Coverage - Critical] Do all hash() implementations include every security-critical field, or are some fields omitted allowing manipulation?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [All hash() methods] [Endianness - Medium] Do all to_be_bytes() calls ensure network byte order for cross-platform compatibility?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [All hash() methods] [Slice Hashing - Medium] When hashing Vec<u8> with as_slice(), is length implicitly included or could different length vectors with same prefix hash identically?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [All hash() methods] [Compression - Medium] When hashing Points with compress().as_bytes(), could invalid points cause compress() to panic or return invalid data?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [All structs] [U32 Overflow - Low] Can signer_id, party_id, or key_id u32 values overflow causing wrap-around or DoS?",

  "[File: src/net.rs] [All structs with Vec] [Empty Vec - Medium] Are empty vectors handled safely in all hash() and verification logic?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [DkgPrivateBegin vs DkgPublicShares] [ID Consistency - Critical] Must signer_ids in DkgPrivateBegin exactly match those who sent valid DkgPublicShares, or can inconsistencies occur?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [DkgEndBegin vs DkgPrivateBegin] [ID Consistency - High] Must signer_ids and key_ids in DkgEndBegin match DkgPrivateBegin, or can they diverge?",
