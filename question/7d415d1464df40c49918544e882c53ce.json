  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Panic on Error] If Scalar::random() can fail internally (e.g., due to RNG failure), does it panic or return an error, and could this be exploited to cause DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Empty Polynomial] What happens if n=0 and the function generates a 1-element polynomial (just the constant term) - is this handled correctly by downstream verification code? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Large Degree] For extremely large but valid n values (e.g., n=1000000), does the polynomial implementation handle evaluation and operations efficiently without overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Zero Coefficients] If Scalar::random() can legitimately return zero (though unlikely), could a polynomial with a zero leading coefficient have effective degree less than n? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Struct: VSS] [Unused Fields] The VSS struct has no fields - is this intentional for a pure utility struct, or should it maintain state to prevent misuse? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Missing Validation] Should random_poly() validate that n is reasonable (e.g., n < some maximum threshold) before attempting polynomial generation? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Error Handling] Should random_poly() return Result instead of panicking on allocation failure or RNG exhaustion, allowing callers to handle errors gracefully? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Degree-Threshold Invariant] Since callers use random_poly(threshold-1), if threshold=1, does n=0 create a degree-0 polynomial that violates the assumption that threshold signatures require multiple parties? (Critical)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Polynomial Secret] Does the constant term (first coefficient) become the private key share, and if so, is there any protection against the caller accidentally exposing or logging the returned polynomial? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Coefficient Distribution] Are the randomly generated scalars uniformly distributed across the entire scalar field, or could bias in certain ranges weaken the polynomial's security properties? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [RNG Requirements] Does the CryptoRng trait bound actually enforce cryptographic security, or is it merely a marker trait that could be implemented by weak RNGs? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Polynomial Cloning] After random_poly() returns, could unauthorized cloning or copying of the Polynomial expose the secret coefficients in memory longer than necessary? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Memory Zeroing] When the Polynomial goes out of scope, are the scalar coefficients securely zeroed from memory, or could they remain accessible to memory inspection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Concurrent Access] If multiple threads call random_poly() with the same RNG instance concurrently, could this cause race conditions or RNG state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Degree Bounds] Is there an implicit maximum degree that the Polynomial type can handle, and could exceeding it cause silent failure or incorrect operations? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Feldman VSS vs Pedersen VSS] Does this implementation provide information-theoretic hiding of shares (Pedersen) or only computational hiding (Feldman), and is this distinction documented? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Polynomial Commitment Binding] After random_poly() generates coefficients, how is it ensured that the public commitment (poly*G) exactly matches these private coefficients without leakage? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Share Distribution] After polynomial generation, how are private shares f(i) distributed to parties, and could random_poly() be involved in a share distribution vulnerability? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Resharing Security] If random_poly() is used during proactive resharing, could old polynomial coefficients be related to new ones in a way that leaks information? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Polynomial Reconstruction] Could an attacker who observes n+1 shares reconstruct the polynomial even without reaching threshold, if the degree is set incorrectly? (Critical)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Cheating Detection] Does the VSS protocol have mechanisms to detect if a party generated their polynomial with incorrect degree, separate from this function? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Multi-Party Computation] In the DKG phase, if multiple parties call random_poly() and their polynomials are summed, could correlations or patterns emerge that weaken security? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Random Oracle Assumption] Does the security of randomly generated polynomials rely on random oracle assumptions that might not hold with the actual RNG implementation? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Boundary: n=0] When n=0, does random_poly() correctly generate a polynomial with 1 coefficient (constant term), and is this constant term cryptographically secure? (High)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Boundary: n=u32::MAX-1] At the upper bound where n=u32::MAX-1, does the n+1 calculation on line 12 equal u32::MAX, and does this cause issues in range or usize conversion? (High)"
