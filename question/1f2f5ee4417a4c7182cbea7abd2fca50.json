  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Low - RNG Blocking] If the RNG blocks or is slow, could ID::new() cause DoS by blocking critical protocol paths?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Low - Memory Usage] Could an attacker cause memory exhaustion by creating or sending large numbers of ID structs?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Reference Lifetimes] Are the reference parameters (&Scalar, &[u8]) correctly bounded, and could lifetime issues cause use-after-free?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Borrow Checking] Do the borrow checker rules prevent simultaneous mutation and verification of ID fields, or could TOCTOU bugs exist?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - PartialEq Implementation] Does the derived PartialEq compare all fields correctly, and could semantic equality differ from structural equality?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Low - Clone Safety] Is the derived Clone implementation safe for cryptographic material, or could clone operations leave secrets in memory?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Low - Debug Output] Does the Debug implementation leak sensitive information (kca values) that should not be logged?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Critical - Proof Construction] Is the Schnorr proof construction kca = k + c*a mathematically sound, and does it correctly prove knowledge of a?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Critical - Verification Soundness] Does the verification equation kca*G = kG + c*A correctly verify the proof, and are there any edge cases where it accepts invalid proofs?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [High - Challenge Binding] Does binding id, K, A, and ctx in the challenge prevent any known Schnorr signature vulnerabilities (parallel attack, related key attacks)?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Medium - Commitment Binding] Does the proof bind both the ID and the polynomial constant A, preventing an attacker from reusing proofs for different IDs or constants?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Group Order] Are all operations performed modulo the group order, and could wraparound or reduction issues cause verification failures?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [High - Domain Tag Collision] Could the domain separation tag 'WSTS/polynomial-constant' collide with other WSTS protocol tags or external protocol tags?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Cross-Context Attacks] If multiple WSTS instances run in parallel with different ctx values, can an attacker replay proofs between instances?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Interoperability] If different implementations of WSTS generate ID proofs, are they compatible, or could implementation differences cause verification failures?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::challenge()] [Medium - Hash Input Ordering] Does the specific ordering of hash inputs (tag, id, K, A, ctx) prevent any known hash collision or length extension attacks?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [High - Immutability] After verification succeeds, can any ID fields be modified to invalidate the proof while keeping the struct valid?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Medium - Multiple Verification] Can verify() be called multiple times on the same ID, and does this introduce any timing or caching vulnerabilities?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - Copy Semantics] Should ID implement Copy trait, or does non-Copy prevent certain classes of bugs with cryptographic material?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [Low - RNG State] Does creating multiple IDs with the same RNG mutate its state correctly, preventing nonce reuse across proofs?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - ID Comparison] When comparing two ID structs for equality, should only the id field matter, or do kG and kca need to match for protocol security?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Struct: ID] [Medium - Proof Malleability] Can different (kG, kca) pairs satisfy verification for the same (id, A) combination, creating proof malleability issues?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::verify()] [Low - Constant-Time Comparison] Is the final verification equation comparison done in constant time to prevent timing attacks?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - ID Range Validation] Are there constraints on valid id scalar values, and could specific id values (0, 1, curve_order-1) cause issues?",
  "[File: src/schnorr.rs] [Function: ID::new()] [High - Secret Validation] Should the secret polynomial constant a be validated (non-zero, in range) before creating a proof?"
