[
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Function: CheckPrivateShares::get_size()] [High - Conversion Panic] The 'try_into().unwrap()' can panic if the size exceeds usize::MAX (on 32-bit systems), causing DoS?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Struct: CheckPrivateShares] [Critical - MultiMult Correctness] Does the MultiMult implementation correctly verify that s*G == sum(poly[k] * x^k) for all shares, or can an incorrect implementation accept invalid shares?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Function: CheckPrivateShares::new()] [High - HashMap Capacity] The HashMap capacity is set to polys.len(), but if shares.len() != polys.len(), could this cause reallocation or performance issues?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Function: CheckPrivateShares::get_scalar()] [Medium - Modulo Operation] The 'i % u' operation assumes u > 0, but is this checked, or can u=0 cause panic?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Function: CheckPrivateShares::get_point()] [Medium - Division] The 'i / u' operation assumes u > 0, but is this checked before division?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: Nonce -> PublicNonce] [Critical - Validation Gap] If a Nonce passes is_valid() but the resulting PublicNonce fails is_valid(), which validation should be trusted, and can this gap enable attacks?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: PolyCommitment -> CheckPrivateShares] [Critical - Consistency] If PolyCommitment.poly.len() doesn't match the threshold used in CheckPrivateShares, can this cause verification bypass or incorrect share acceptance?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: SignatureShare -> Signature] [Critical - Aggregation] If SignatureShares have inconsistent key_ids sets, can the aggregation produce a valid Signature that shouldn't verify?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: TupleProof -> Encrypted Shares] [High - Proof Binding] Is the TupleProof properly bound to the specific DH shared secret and encrypted share, preventing proof reuse across different share exchanges?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: validate_key_id() -> SignatureShare] [High - ID Validation Order] Are key_ids in SignatureShare validated using validate_key_id() before Lagrange interpolation, or can invalid IDs cause computation errors?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: Signature::verify() -> Taproot] [Critical - Tweak Handling] If Signature::verify() is used with a tweaked public key, does it properly account for the tweak, or must this be handled externally?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: PublicNonce Add -> Aggregation] [Critical - Addition Bug Impact] Given the Add trait bug for PublicNonce, how does this affect nonce aggregation in the signing protocol, and can it enable signature forgery?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: Nonce One/Zero -> Validation] [High - Trait Interaction] Can the One/Zero traits for Nonce create invalid nonces that bypass validation if is_valid() is called before trait construction?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: CheckPrivateShares -> DKG] [Critical - Share Verification Completeness] Does CheckPrivateShares verify all required properties (correct polynomial evaluation, no malicious shares), or can some DKG poisoning attacks bypass MultiMult?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Interaction: PolyCommitment Display -> Logging] [Medium - Information Leakage] Does the Display trait for PolyCommitment leak sensitive information in logs that could aid attackers?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Struct: PolyCommitment] [High - Deserialization Validation] Does the Deserialize implementation for PolyCommitment validate that poly is non-empty and all points are valid?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Struct: Nonce] [Critical - Deserialization Bypass] Can a Nonce be deserialized with d=0 or e=0, bypassing the is_valid() check if validation isn't called after deserialization?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Struct: PublicNonce] [High - Deserialization Validation] Does the Deserialize implementation validate that D and E are on the curve and not identity/generator points?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Struct: SignatureShare] [High - Deserialization Validation] Does Deserialize for SignatureShare validate that key_ids are in range and z_i is a valid scalar?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Struct: Signature] [Critical - Deserialization Validation] Does Deserialize for Signature validate that R is on the curve and z is in the scalar field?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Struct: TupleProof] [High - Deserialization Validation] Does Deserialize for TupleProof validate point validity for R and rB?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [All Structs] [Medium - Serde Security] Are there any custom Serialize/Deserialize implementations that could introduce vulnerabilities, or is the derive macro safe?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [All Structs] [Medium - Deserialization DoS] Can deserialization of extremely large vectors (poly, key_ids) cause memory exhaustion before validation?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Function: CheckPrivateShares::new()] [High - Unwrap Panic] Multiple 'try_into().unwrap()' calls can panic on type conversion failure - are all inputs validated to prevent DoS?",
  "[File: src/common.rs] [Function: CheckPrivateShares::get_scalar()] [High - HashMap Access Panic] Direct HashMap access with '[]' operator can panic if key is missing - should this use .get() instead?"
