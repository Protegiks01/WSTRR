  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Boundary: threshold=2] For the minimum practical threshold of 2, n=1 creates a degree-1 (linear) polynomial - are there special security considerations for low-degree polynomials? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Boundary: threshold=num_keys] If threshold equals num_keys (all parties required), does n=num_keys-1 create any edge cases in subsequent operations? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Attack: Malicious Degree] Could a malicious party call random_poly() with n=0 during DKG, commit to the resulting constant polynomial, and then claim they can reconstruct any share value? (Critical)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Attack: RNG Manipulation] If an attacker can control or predict the RNG state before random_poly() is called, can they predetermine the polynomial and thus all private shares? (Critical)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Attack: Degree Inflation] Could an attacker generate a polynomial with degree n' > threshold-1, use only the first threshold coefficients, and keep the extra coefficients as a backdoor? (High)",

  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Attack: RNG Exhaustion] Could an attacker intentionally deplete the RNG entropy pool before honest parties call random_poly(), forcing them to use weak randomness? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Integration: PolyCommitment] How is the polynomial from random_poly() converted into a PolyCommitment, and could this conversion introduce vulnerabilities? (High)",

  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Integration: State Machine] Can the state machine ensure random_poly() is called exactly once per DKG round, preventing polynomial replacement attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Integration: Serialization] If the polynomial from random_poly() is serialized, could deserialization create a different polynomial or allow degree manipulation? (Medium)",

  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Rust: Drop Implementation] Does the Polynomial type implement Drop to securely zero memory, or could dropped polynomials leak coefficients? (Medium)",

  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Rust: Send/Sync] Is the Polynomial from random_poly() safe to send across thread boundaries, or could concurrent access cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: src/vss.rs] [Function: random_poly()] [Documentation] The function documentation says 'degree n' but generates n+1 coefficients - is this potentially confusing and could it lead to off-by-one errors in calling code? (Medium)",
