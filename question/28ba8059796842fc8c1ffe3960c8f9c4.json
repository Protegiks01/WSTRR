  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Critical - Key Derivation Chain] The chain make_shared_secret() -> make_shared_secret_from_key() -> ansi_x963_derive_key() -> encrypt() creates encryption keys - if any step produces predictable output, the entire DKG share encryption breaks. Is each step independently validated?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Critical - Domain Separation Completeness] Do expand_to_scalar(), make_shared_secret_from_key(), and ansi_x963_derive_key() use mutually exclusive domain strings across ALL protocol operations to prevent cross-context collisions?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [High - Scalar Zero Handling] If expand_to_scalar() or hash_to_scalar() produce zero scalars, and these are used as DH private keys in make_shared_secret(), the result is always point-at-infinity. Does WSTS check for zero at each stage?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Critical - Encryption Nonce Independence] Are the nonces generated by encrypt() truly independent from any scalars derived by expand_to_scalar()? If both use the same RNG state, patterns could emerge enabling correlation attacks.",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [High - Point Validation Gaps] None of the functions explicitly validate that Points are on-curve or non-identity before operations. Is this validation performed by the Point type itself, or could invalid points slip through?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Medium - Error Handling Consistency] decrypt() returns specific EncryptionError variants (MissingNonce, MissingData), while expand_to_scalar() returns EllipticCurveError. Do callers handle all error types correctly without panicking?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Critical - Key Lifecycle Management] After make_shared_secret() derives an encryption key, is it immediately zeroized from memory after encrypt()/decrypt() completes? Lingering keys in memory could be leaked through heap attacks.",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [High - RNG State Isolation] If create_rng() is called multiple times in quick succession, could the OS entropy pool return correlated outputs leading to related nonces in encryption and related scalars in DKG?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Medium - Constant-Time Operations] Do Point and Scalar operations use constant-time implementations, or could timing variations in make_shared_secret() and expand_to_scalar() leak private keys through cache timing attacks?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Cross-Function] [Critical - Nonce/Key Separation] WSTS uses expand_to_scalar() for various purposes and encrypt() for share protection - is there absolute guarantee that nonce values from encryption never collide with scalar values used in signing?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [Critical - DKG Share Encryption Security] When encrypt() is used to protect DKG shares sent between parties, if an attacker MitM's the DH public key exchange, can they decrypt all shares and reconstruct the group private key?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [Critical - Binding Value Derivation] If hash_to_scalar() is used to compute binding values in FROST signing, does the input hasher include all public nonces in the correct order to prevent signature forgery via nonce manipulation?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [High - Party ID Binding] Do any of the utility functions bind operations to specific party IDs? Without party ID binding, can an attacker replay encrypted shares or derived keys from one party to another?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [Critical - Round ID Binding] Are DKG round IDs or signing round IDs incorporated into domain strings or shared_info parameters to prevent cross-round replay of encrypted shares or derived keys?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [High - Coordinator Authentication] When the coordinator distributes public keys for DH key exchange before DKG share encryption, are these keys authenticated? Unauthenticated keys enable MitM attacks on share encryption.",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [Critical - Taproot Key Tweaking] If expand_to_scalar() is used to derive taproot tweak values, does the domain string prevent collisions with DKG or signing scalars that could compromise the tweaked private key?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [High - Schnorr ID Proof Binding] Are Schnorr ID proofs in DKG bound to the same domain strings as expand_to_scalar() operations? Inconsistent binding could allow proof replay or substitution attacks.",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [Medium - Network Message Encryption] If encrypt() is used for general network message confidentiality beyond DKG shares, are message types included in AAD to prevent ciphertext type confusion attacks?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [Critical - Key Aggregation Security] When multiple signers use make_shared_secret() with the coordinator's public key, if the coordinator is malicious and chooses a related-key public key, can they learn multiple private keys?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Protocol Integration] [High - Signature Share Encryption] If signature shares are encrypted with encrypt() during transmission, are signing round IDs and message hashes bound to encryption to prevent share substitution across different signing sessions?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Function: expand_to_scalar()] [Medium - XMD Security Level] Does ExpandMsgXmd with SHA256 provide 128-bit security as required by hash-to-curve standards, and is this sufficient for WSTS's target security level?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Function: expand_to_scalar()] [Low - Buffer Initialization] Line 30 initializes buf = [0u8; 32] - could a compiler optimization eliminate this zero-initialization if fill_bytes() immediately overwrites it, potentially leaking stack memory?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Function: hash_to_scalar()] [High - Hash Function Selection] SHA256 is used throughout - is this compatible with all curve types WSTS might support, or could future curve additions require different hash functions causing migration issues?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Function: make_shared_secret()] [Critical - Scalar Multiplication Security] Does private_key * public_key at line 49 use a constant-time scalar multiplication algorithm, or could branch prediction and cache timing leak private_key bits?",
  "[File: src/util.rs] [Function: make_shared_secret()] [High - Cofactor Multiplication] For curves with non-trivial cofactor, should make_shared_secret() multiply the result by the cofactor to clear small subgroup components and prevent small subgroup attacks?"
