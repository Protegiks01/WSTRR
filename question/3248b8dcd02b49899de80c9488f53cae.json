  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Signer Coverage - High] Does validate() ensure that all signers in the signers HashMap are also present in signer_key_ids with at least one key?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Orphan Keys - Medium] Can key_ids exist in the key_ids HashMap without being assigned to any signer in signer_key_ids?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Duplicate Detection - High] Does validate() check for duplicate key_ids across different signers, which could allow threshold bypass?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Parameter Validation - Medium] Are num_signers and num_keys validated to be non-zero before being used in ID range checks?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Integer Overflow - Low] Could extremely large num_signers or num_keys values cause integer overflow in validate_signer_id or validate_key_id?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Public Key Validation - Critical] Does validate() check that the ecdsa::PublicKey values are valid points on the curve and not identity?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Malformed Key Detection - High] If an ecdsa::PublicKey is malformed or invalid, does validate() catch this before the key is used in signing?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Error Reporting - Low] Does the ConfigError::InvalidSignerId or ConfigError::InvalidKeyId provide enough context to identify which specific validation failed?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Impl: Debug for PublicKeys] [Information Leakage - Medium] Does the Debug implementation using BTreeMap expose public keys in logs, potentially revealing participant identities?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Impl: Debug for PublicKeys] [Signer Key IDs Omission - Low] Why does the Debug impl omit signer_key_ids field? Could this hide important mapping information during debugging?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Impl: Debug for PublicKeys] [BTreeMap Conversion - Low] Does converting HashMap to BTreeMap for Debug change iteration order in ways that could leak information through timing?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Module: coordinator] [Visibility Control - Medium] Are the coordinator module's public items properly restricted to prevent external code from bypassing state machine invariants?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Module: signer] [Visibility Control - Medium] Are the signer module's public items properly restricted to prevent malicious external manipulation of signer state?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: hashbrown] [External Dependency - Low] Does using hashbrown::HashMap instead of std::HashMap provide security benefits, or could it introduce vulnerabilities?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: HashSet] [Collision Resistance - Medium] Is hashbrown::HashSet resistant to hash collision attacks when storing untrusted signer/key IDs?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: validate_key_id] [Function Trust - High] Does validate_key_id in common.rs properly validate IDs, or could bugs there bypass PublicKeys::validate()?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: validate_signer_id] [Function Trust - High] Does validate_signer_id correctly handle edge cases like ID=0 or ID=num_signers?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: Signature] [Type Safety - Medium] Is the Signature type from common.rs properly validated before being wrapped in OperationResult::Sign?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: Point] [Curve Point Validation - Critical] Does the Point type from curve::point enforce that all points are valid curve points and not identity?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: ecdsa::PublicKey] [Key Validation - Critical] Does ecdsa::PublicKey validate keys at construction time, or could invalid keys be stored in PublicKeys?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: AggregatorError] [Error Context - Medium] Does AggregatorError preserve enough information about which signature shares failed aggregation?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: DkgFailure] [Failure Types - High] What types of DkgFailure exist in net.rs, and could certain failure types be exploited to frame honest signers?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Import: SchnorrProof] [Proof Validation - Critical] Does SchnorrProof from taproot.rs validate proofs at construction, or is validation deferred to usage?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Generic: StateMachine<S, E>] [Lifetime Safety - Low] Could lifetime issues in implementors of StateMachine cause use-after-free if states reference borrowed data?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Type: u32 IDs] [ID Type Choice - Medium] Why use u32 for signer and key IDs? Could this limit scalability or cause issues with extremely large deployments?"
