  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareRequest] [Signature Type Mismatch - High] Can signature_type differ from what was in the original NonceRequest, causing signature verification failures?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: SignatureShareRequest::hash()] [Nonce Order - High] Does hashing iterate nonce_responses in a deterministic order (line 417-419), or can reordering cause hash changes?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareRequest] [Empty Nonces - Critical] Can nonce_responses be an empty vector, causing binding value computation to fail or use wrong values?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareRequest] [Taproot Merkle Consistency - High] For Taproot signatures, does merkle_root match what was in NonceRequest, or can it be changed?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: SignatureShareRequest::hash()] [Domain Separation - Medium] Does hashing signature_type last (lines 422-431) ensure proper domain separation from Frost/Schnorr/Taproot?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareResponse] [Share Count - Critical] Is signature_shares.len() validated against the signer's key_ids count, or can mismatched counts occur?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareResponse] [Duplicate Shares - Critical] Can signature_shares contain duplicate IDs, allowing double-counting during aggregation?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareResponse] [Zero Share - Critical] Are signature shares validated to be non-zero scalars (z_i), or can zero shares enable forgery?",

  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: SignatureShareResponse] [Empty Response - High] Can signature_shares be empty, allowing a signer to participate without contributing shares?",

  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: SignatureShareResponse::hash()] [Hash Determinism - Medium] Is iteration over signature_shares deterministic (line 457-463), or can reordering cause hash changes?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: SignatureShareResponse::hash()] [Key IDs Hash - Medium] Are key_ids within each signature_share hashed in a deterministic order (lines 460-462)?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Signature Reuse - Critical] Can the same signature be reused across different message types by replaying packets with modified msg but same sig?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Unknown Signer Bypass - High] For messages requiring signer validation, does returning false on unknown signer_id (lines 519-523, 533-537, etc.) prevent all attacks?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Coordinator Impersonation - Critical] Can a malicious signer sign a coordinator message (DkgBegin, NonceRequest, etc.) and have it accepted if signer key equals coordinator key?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Early Return - High] Does the function's multiple early returns ensure all validation paths are covered, or can some messages slip through unverified?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Warn Only - Medium] Do the warn!() calls (lines 496, 502, etc.) indicate that verification failures might not be properly propagated to callers?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Comment Accuracy - High] Does the TODO comment about Frost V5 (lines 541-543) indicate a known security issue with off-by-one ID handling?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Missing Message Types - Critical] Does the match statement (lines 493-599) cover all Message enum variants, or can new variants bypass verification?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [Public Key Availability - High] What happens if signers_public_keys.signers is empty or doesn't contain expected IDs - can packets be accepted without verification?",

  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: Packet::verify()] [True Return - High] Does returning true at the end (line 600) mean successful verification, or could it be reached incorrectly?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: Message] [Type Confusion - High] Can deserialization produce one Message variant but serialization claims it's another, bypassing type-based verification?"
