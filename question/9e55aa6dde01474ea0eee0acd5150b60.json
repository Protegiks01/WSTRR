  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: DkgPrivateBegin::hash()] [DoS - Medium] Can extremely large signer_ids or key_ids vectors cause expensive hash computation leading to DoS?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgPrivateShares] [Share Encryption - Critical] Are the encrypted shares in the HashMap properly authenticated with AES-GCM, or could they be modified in transit without detection?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgPrivateShares] [Missing Shares - High] Can shares vector be incomplete (missing dst_key_id entries for some recipients), allowing selective share distribution attacks?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: DkgPrivateShares::hash()] [Hash Determinism - High] Does sorting dst_ids (line 209-210) ensure deterministic hashing, or could HashMap iteration order still cause non-determinism?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgPrivateShares] [Duplicate Shares - High] Can a malicious signer include duplicate dst_key_id entries in the HashMap, sending multiple different encrypted shares to the same recipient?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgPrivateShares] [Wrong Recipient - Critical] Is there validation that dst_key_id values in shares correspond to legitimate participants from DkgPrivateBegin.key_ids?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgPrivateShares] [Src ID Validation - High] Are src_party_id values (line 198) validated to match the signer's actual party IDs from their DkgPublicShares.comms?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: DkgPrivateShares::hash()] [Nested Loop Security - Medium] Does the double loop over shares and dst_ids (lines 207-214) properly handle malicious nested structures?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgPrivateShares] [Empty Encrypted Share - High] Can encrypted share Vec<u8> be empty, bypassing share validation and allowing malicious shares?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgPrivateShares] [DoS - Medium] Can attacker send shares with extremely large encrypted Vec<u8> values causing memory exhaustion?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: DkgPrivateShares::hash()] [Hash Collision - Medium] If two signers send shares with different orderings but same content after sorting, will they have same hash allowing signature reuse?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgEndBegin] [Premature Finalization - High] Can coordinator send DkgEndBegin before all expected private shares are received, causing honest signers to finalize with incomplete data?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgEndBegin] [Signer List Manipulation - High] Can coordinator modify signer_ids list to exclude signers who reported bad shares, hiding evidence of malicious behavior?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgEndBegin] [Key ID Mismatch - Critical] Must key_ids exactly match those from DkgPrivateBegin, or can coordinator change the set causing inconsistent final key generation?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: DkgEndBegin::hash()] [Hash Order - Medium] Does hashing key_ids before signer_ids (lines 234-239) match DkgPrivateBegin's hash order for consistency?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgEndBegin] [Empty Lists - High] Are empty signer_ids or key_ids allowed, forcing DKG abortion and causing DoS?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgEnd] [Status Manipulation - High] Can a malicious signer send DkgStatus::Success even when they detected bad shares, hiding attacks from the coordinator?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Function: DkgEnd::hash()] [Missing Status Hash - Critical] Why is status field not included in hash() (lines 255-259), allowing attackers to change DkgStatus without invalidating the signature?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgEnd] [Signer ID Validation - High] Is signer_id validated to be in the expected set from DkgEndBegin.signer_ids, or can unknown signers send DkgEnd messages?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: DkgEnd] [DKG ID Mismatch - High] Is dkg_id strictly checked to match the current round, preventing replay of DkgEnd from previous rounds?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: DkgFailure] [Information Leak - Medium] Does returning detailed failure reasons in BadPublicShares/BadPrivateShares reveal information that helps attackers?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: BadPrivateShare] [Tuple Proof Validation - High] Is tuple_proof properly validated before accepting the BadPrivateShare report, or can false accusations be made?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Struct: BadPrivateShare] [Shared Key Validation - High] Is shared_key validated to be a valid curve point, or can invalid points in the proof cause verification failures?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: DkgFailure::MissingPublicShares] [Set Validation - Medium] Can the HashSet contain arbitrary signer_ids, allowing false accusations of missing shares?",
  "[File: src/net.rs] [Enum: DkgFailure::BadPrivateShares] [HashMap Validation - Medium] Are the HashMap keys validated to be legitimate signer_ids, preventing injection of fake bad share reports?"
