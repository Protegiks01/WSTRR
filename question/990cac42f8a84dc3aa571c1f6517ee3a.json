  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Trait: StateMachine] [State Transition Bypass - Critical] Can an implementation of move_to() bypass the can_move_to() check, allowing illegal state transitions that skip DKG validation steps or permit signing without completing DKG?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Trait: StateMachine] [Race Condition - High] If multiple threads call move_to() concurrently without synchronization, can the state machine enter an inconsistent state where can_move_to() passes but move_to() executes with stale state data?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Trait: StateMachine] [State Machine Invariant - Critical] Does the trait contract enforce that can_move_to() must be called before move_to(), or can implementations violate this ordering and bypass state validation logic?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Trait: StateMachine] [Replay Attack - High] Can an attacker replay a previously valid state transition after the machine has moved forward, causing the state machine to revert to an earlier state with compromised secrets?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Trait: StateMachine] [Generic Type Safety - Medium] Are the generic parameters S (state) and E (error) constrained appropriately to prevent type confusion attacks where malicious state values bypass validation?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Propagation - Medium] Does the From trait conversion from SignerError and CoordinatorError preserve all security-critical error context, or can important details be lost during error wrapping?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Clone Trait - Low] The Error enum derives Clone - can cloning errors with embedded sensitive data (like malicious signer IDs or failure details) lead to information leakage in logs?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Large Enum Variant - Medium] The clippy warning for large_enum_variant is suppressed - could the size difference between variants cause stack overflow or performance DoS when error handling is nested deeply?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgPublicTimeout] [Timeout Manipulation - High] Can an attacker manipulate network conditions to cause DkgPublicTimeout repeatedly, forcing honest signers to mark legitimate participants as malicious?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgPublicTimeout] [Signer ID Injection - Critical] Does the Vec<u32> of waiting signer IDs undergo validation before being used to determine who is malicious, or can out-of-range IDs cause panics or incorrect blame?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgPrivateTimeout] [Private Share Exposure - Critical] If DkgPrivateTimeout occurs, are private shares that were partially received properly zeroized, or could they leak through error messages or lingering memory?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgPrivateTimeout] [Byzantine Timeout - High] Can a malicious coordinator selectively timeout some signers during DKG private phase to exclude them from the final key, manipulating the threshold requirements?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgEndTimeout] [Partial DKG Completion - Critical] If DkgEndTimeout occurs with some valid shares received, does the implementation prevent using a partially completed DKG that doesn't meet threshold requirements?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgEndTimeout] [Timeout Vector Validation - Medium] Are the signer IDs in the timeout Vec validated to be within valid range [0, num_signers), or could invalid IDs cause integer overflow or out-of-bounds access?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgEndFailure] [Malicious Signer Detection - Critical] How is the malicious_signers HashSet populated, and can an attacker manipulate DkgFailure reports to frame honest signers as malicious?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgEndFailure] [Reported Failures Validation - High] Does the HashMap<u32, DkgFailure> validate that reporting signer IDs are legitimate participants before accepting their failure reports?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgEndFailure] [Failure Report Forgery - Critical] Can a malicious signer submit multiple DkgFailure reports under different signer IDs to bias the malicious detection algorithm?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgEndFailure] [HashSet vs HashMap Consistency - High] Is there a guarantee that every key in reported_failures that indicates a malicious action results in that signer being added to malicious_signers?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: DkgError::DkgEndFailure] [Clone Semantics - Medium] Since DkgError derives Clone, does cloning DkgEndFailure with large reported_failures or malicious_signers collections cause performance DoS?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::NonceTimeout] [Nonce Reuse Detection - Critical] If NonceTimeout occurs and signing is retried, does the system guarantee fresh nonces are generated, or could timeout manipulation lead to nonce reuse?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::NonceTimeout] [Valid vs Malicious Classification - Critical] The error contains both valid responders and malicious signers - can an attacker manipulate timing to appear valid while actually contributing invalid shares?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::NonceTimeout] [Partial Signature Set - High] If a NonceTimeout occurs with valid_responses containing enough key IDs for threshold, could the coordinator bypass waiting and produce a signature with potentially corrupted shares?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::NonceTimeout] [Malicious Signer Vector - High] Are the malicious signer IDs in Vec<u32> validated to be valid participant IDs before being used for blacklisting or reputation tracking?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::InsufficientSigners] [Threshold Bypass - Critical] When InsufficientSigners is returned, does the system prevent attempting signature aggregation with fewer than threshold key IDs?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::InsufficientSigners] [Malicious Detection - High] Can a Byzantine coordinator falsely claim InsufficientSigners to halt signing even when threshold signers are available and honest?"
