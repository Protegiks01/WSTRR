  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPublicShares] [Information Leakage - Medium] Does exposing the complete list of party IDs with missing public shares in error variant MissingPublicShares(Vec<u32>) allow an attacker to map the network topology, identify offline or censored parties, and strategically target specific signers for DoS attacks during subsequent DKG rounds?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPrivateShares] [Information Leakage - Medium] Does the tuple structure (u32, u32) in MissingPrivateShares reveal both the sender party ID and the recipient party ID of missing private shares, enabling an attacker to reconstruct the complete private share distribution graph and identify which parties failed to receive secrets from which other parties?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::BadPublicShares] [Malicious Signer Detection Bypass - High] Can an attacker deliberately send invalid public shares that trigger BadPublicShares(Vec<u32>) to multiple honest parties simultaneously, causing inconsistent error states where different parties identify different sets of malicious participants, preventing consensus on which signers to exclude?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::BadPrivateShares] [DKG Share Validation Bypass - Critical] If BadPrivateShares(Vec<u32>) only tracks party IDs but not the specific key IDs within each party's share set, can a malicious weighted signer provide valid shares for some key IDs but invalid shares for others, partially passing validation while still corrupting the DKG output for a subset of their controlled keys?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPublicShares] [Threshold Bypass - Critical] If the coordinator accepts DKG completion despite MissingPublicShares errors from parties that together control key IDs below the threshold, but those parties later appear with valid shares during signing, does this allow effective threshold reduction by excluding their contributions from DKG validation but including them in signing?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPrivateShares] [DoS Vector - Medium] Can an attacker cause excessive memory allocation by triggering MissingPrivateShares errors with the maximum possible Vec<(u32, u32)> size (e.g., n * n tuples for n parties), forcing the coordinator to store and process extremely large error vectors when aggregating DKG failures?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::BadPublicShares] [State Machine Desync - High] If different parties generate BadPublicShares errors with different Vec<u32> contents due to network message reordering or timing variations, can this cause honest parties to have inconsistent views of which public shares failed verification, leading to state machine desync where some proceed to private shares phase while others abort?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::Point] [Error Granularity Loss - Medium] Does wrapping PointError via the From trait implementation lose critical context about which specific point operation failed (polynomial evaluation, commitment verification, public key computation), making it impossible to distinguish between different attack vectors when debugging malicious behavior?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::TryFromInt] [Integer Overflow Detection Failure - High] Does the generic TryFromInt error variant hide which specific integer conversion failed (party ID, key ID, polynomial degree, threshold value), potentially masking integer overflow attacks where an attacker provides values that wrap or truncate to valid ranges after conversion?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Trait: From<TryFromIntError> for DkgError] [Error Context Loss - Medium] Does the From implementation for TryFromIntError discard the original error details (_e parameter ignored), losing information about whether the conversion failed due to overflow, underflow, or sign mismatch, which could be critical for identifying malicious inputs versus legitimate edge cases?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError] [Serialization Attack - Medium] Since DkgError implements Serialize/Deserialize, can a malicious party send crafted error messages over the network with arbitrarily large Vec<u32> or Vec<(u32, u32)> payloads to consume bandwidth and memory, using the error reporting mechanism itself as a DoS vector?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPrivateShares] [Privacy Leakage - High] Does transmitting MissingPrivateShares(Vec<(u32, u32)>) over the network in serialized form reveal the intended recipient mapping for private shares to eavesdroppers, potentially allowing traffic analysis attacks to determine which parties should have received shares from which other parties?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::BadPrivateShares] [Validation Bypass - Critical] If the error only stores party IDs (Vec<u32>) and not the actual invalid share values or commitments, can diagnostic code fail to distinguish between shares that have wrong scalar values versus shares that violate polynomial commitment equations, allowing some classes of invalid shares to be accepted?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPublicShares] [Coordinator State Confusion - High] If the coordinator collects MissingPublicShares errors from multiple signers but the Vec<u32> sets are disjoint (each signer reports different missing parties), does the aggregation logic correctly identify that ALL reported parties are missing, or could it incorrectly conclude that only the intersection set is missing?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError] [Clone Semantics - Low] Since DkgError implements Clone, can cloning large error vectors with many party IDs or tuples cause performance issues or memory exhaustion when errors are propagated through multiple layers of the protocol stack?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::BadPublicShares] [Duplicate Party ID Handling - Medium] Does the Vec<u32> in BadPublicShares allow duplicate party IDs to be inserted, and if so, can an attacker exploit this to amplify error reporting (e.g., reporting the same malicious party ID multiple times) to trigger incorrect threshold counting or ban list logic?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPrivateShares] [Tuple Ordering Attack - Low] Are the (u32, u32) tuples in MissingPrivateShares validated to ensure the first element (sender) is different from the second element (receiver), or can an attacker insert self-referential tuples like (5, 5) to confuse diagnostic logic that assumes shares are exchanged between distinct parties?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError] [PartialEq Implementation - Low] Since DkgError implements PartialEq, could comparison operations on error variants with large Vec payloads become expensive and exploitable for timing side-channels, especially if error comparison is done in authentication or verification paths?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::Point] [Error Propagation Chain - Medium] When PointError is converted to DkgError::Point via From trait, does the error lose stack trace or location information that would help identify whether the point error originated from polynomial commitment computation, public key aggregation, or Schnorr proof verification?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError] [Missing Variants - High] Does the DkgError enum lack variants for critical failure modes such as duplicate party IDs in public shares, polynomial degree mismatches, threshold value violations, or key ID range errors, forcing these conditions to be either silently ignored or inappropriately mapped to existing error types?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::BadPublicShares] [Malicious Party Identification - High] If multiple parties collude to provide invalid public shares but only some are detected and included in BadPublicShares(Vec<u32>), can the undetected colluding parties continue to participate in DKG, potentially allowing them to bias the group key or reduce effective security even though some attackers were identified?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPublicShares] [Race Condition - Medium] If MissingPublicShares errors are generated based on a timeout rather than cryptographic proof of absence, can a malicious party send their public shares just after the timeout to some parties but not others, causing inconsistent error states and preventing DKG agreement?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::MissingPrivateShares] [Encrypted Share Confusion - High] Since private shares are encrypted before transmission, does the MissingPrivateShares error correctly distinguish between shares that were never sent versus shares that were sent but failed decryption, or could encryption failures be misclassified as missing shares, hiding actual cryptographic attacks?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: DkgError::TryFromInt] [Silent Truncation Risk - Critical] If party IDs or key IDs are converted from larger integer types (e.g., usize, u64) to u32 and the conversion fails, does TryFromInt appropriately halt DKG, or could there be code paths that catch and ignore this error, allowing truncated IDs to be used in polynomial operations or Lagrange interpolation?",
  "[File: src/errors.rs] [Enum: AggregatorError::BadPolyCommitments] [Signature Forgery - Critical] Does storing scalar values directly in BadPolyCommitments(Vec<Scalar>) instead of party IDs allow an attacker to learn which specific scalar polynomial commitments failed, potentially revealing information about honest signers' private polynomials that could be exploited to forge signatures?"
