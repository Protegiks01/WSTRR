  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::InsufficientSigners] [Malicious ID Validation - Medium] Does the Vec<u32> of malicious signer IDs get validated for duplicates, and could duplicate IDs cause incorrect threshold calculations?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::Aggregator] [Error Wrapping - High] When AggregatorError is wrapped, does critical information about which specific signature shares failed validation get preserved for security auditing?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: SignError::Coordinator] [Error Context Loss - Medium] Does wrapping CoordinatorError in SignError lose important state machine context that could help diagnose attack patterns?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::Dkg] [Point Validation - Critical] When DKG succeeds with a Point, is the point validated to be on the curve and not the identity element before being used as the group public key?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::Dkg] [Clone Semantics - Medium] Since OperationResult derives Clone, can cloning a DKG result with a Point leak sensitive key material if the Point contains secret data?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::Sign] [Signature Validation - Critical] Is the Signature validated immediately after construction, or could a malformed signature from aggregation be returned as success?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::SignSchnorr] [Schnorr Proof Verification - Critical] Before returning SignSchnorr success, is the SchnorrProof verified against the expected message and public key?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::SignSchnorr] [BIP-340 Compliance - High] Does the SchnorrProof in SignSchnorr result enforce BIP-340 even-Y parity rules, or could invalid proofs pass through?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::SignTaproot] [Taproot Tweak Validation - Critical] For SignTaproot results, is the SchnorrProof validated against the tweaked public key, not the untweaked group key?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::SignTaproot] [BIP-341 Compliance - High] Does SignTaproot enforce BIP-341 tweak computation and merkle root binding, or could an attacker use an incorrect tweak?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::DkgError] [Error Disclosure - Medium] When DkgError is returned in OperationResult, could the error details reveal sensitive information about participant identities or DKG secrets?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult::SignError] [Timing Attack - Low] Could measuring the time difference between SignError variants reveal information about which signers are offline vs malicious?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Enum: OperationResult] [Result Type Confusion - Medium] Can an implementation mistakenly interpret a DkgError as success, or vice versa, due to the flat enum structure without Result wrapper?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicKeys::signers] [HashMap Collision - Medium] Does the HashMap<u32, ecdsa::PublicKey> use a cryptographically secure hasher, or could an attacker craft signer IDs to cause hash collisions?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicKeys::key_ids] [Key ID Collision - High] Can duplicate key_ids in the HashMap cause a single malicious key to be used in place of multiple expected keys, bypassing threshold?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicKeys::signer_key_ids] [Mapping Integrity - Critical] Can the signer_key_ids mapping be manipulated so a signer claims to control key_ids they don't actually have private shares for?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicKeys::signer_key_ids] [HashSet Uniqueness - High] Does the HashSet<u32> for each signer properly enforce uniqueness, or could duplicate key_ids cause incorrect Lagrange coefficient calculations?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicKeys] [Default Trait - Medium] The Default trait creates empty HashMaps - can code paths using Default accidentally skip PublicKeys initialization, leading to missing key validation?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicKeys] [PartialEq Implementation - Low] Is PartialEq comparison of ecdsa::PublicKey secure against timing attacks that could leak key relationships?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Struct: PublicKeys] [Clone Semantics - Medium] Cloning PublicKeys copies all HashMaps - could this lead to stale key data if original is updated but clone is not?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Signer ID Validation - High] Does validate_signer_id properly check that signer IDs are in range [0, num_signers), or could off-by-one errors allow invalid IDs?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Key ID Validation - High] Does validate_key_id ensure key IDs are in range [0, num_keys), and are there edge cases where num_keys=0 causes issues?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Early Return - Medium] If signer validation fails early, does the function return before checking key_ids and signer_key_ids, potentially missing other validation errors?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Completeness Check - Critical] Does validate() ensure that every key_id has a corresponding public key, and every signer controls at least one key_id?",
  "[File: src/state_machine/mod.rs] [Function: PublicKeys::validate()] [Cross-Reference Validation - Critical] Does validate() check that key_ids referenced in signer_key_ids actually exist in the key_ids HashMap?"
